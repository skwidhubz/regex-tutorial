## Summary

Regular expressions, or regex, are patterns used to match and manipulate text. There are several components to regex patterns that allow for powerful and flexible matching. Character classes are used to match specific sets of characters, such as digits or letters. Metacharacters, such as the period and asterisk, represent any character or any number of characters respectively. Anchors, like the caret and dollar sign, are used to match the beginning or end of a line or string. Quantifiers, such as the plus sign and question mark, control the number of times a character or group of characters can appear. Finally, grouping constructs, such as parentheses and square brackets, allow for complex combinations of patterns to be matched. By combining these components, regex patterns can be tailored to match almost any text pattern, making them a powerful tool in data processing and text manipulation.

Here is an example of a regex statment which expresses matching an HTML tag;
` /^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/ `

` /^ :` This indicates the start of the string.
` <: ` This matches the opening angle bracket of an HTML tag.
`([a-z]+):` This is a capturing group that matches one or more lowercase letters of the alphabet (a-z). It captures the tag name, which must come immediately after the opening angle bracket.
`([^<]+)*:` This is a non-capturing group that matches zero or more characters that are not an opening angle bracket. It matches any attributes that may be present in the HTML tag.
`(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)`: This is a non-capturing group that matches either the end of the HTML tag i.e. `>` followed by any characters and then the tag name captured in the first group, followed by `</)`, or a self-closing tag i.e. one or more whitespace characters followed by `/>)`.
`$:` This indicates the end of the string.
So, putting it all together, this regex statement matches any string that represents a valid HTML tag, including any attributes and the content within the tag.
